This is a classic two-player Pong game created using Python's turtle graphics library. It features two paddles, a ball, and a scoreboard to track points.

Key Features
Two-Player Mode: Control the paddles using the Up and Down arrow keys for the right paddle and the W and S keys for the left paddle.

Collision Detection: The game includes logic to detect when the ball collides with the top/bottom walls or the paddles.

Scoring System: A scoreboard updates in real-time as players miss the ball.

Modular Code: The game's components (the paddles, the ball, and the scoreboard) are organized into separate classes for easy readability and maintenance.

Project Files
